### Web Generator Drill
***

This is a drill that I completed at The Tech Academy.  In this drill, students were asked to create a program in Python that automatically
generates a simple HTML web page, that also has a GUI that allows users to generate new text for the body of the HTML page.  A database is
also incorporated into the program, that allows users to view all previous content, and to reuse content to insert into the body of the 
HTML page.  The requirements for this drill were to use Python 3.5, tKinter, sqlite3, and Visual Studio 2013.
