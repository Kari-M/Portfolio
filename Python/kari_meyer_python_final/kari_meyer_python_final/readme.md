### Python Final Project
***

As part of the Python course at The Tech Academy, students are required to complete a final project of their choice.  
In this project, I wanted to create a program that will potentially develop further for the non-profit that I used to work for.  
This non-profit, called Asante Foundation, needs a way to register sponsors for their largest annual fundraiser, 
The Oregon Wine Experience.  The sponsors receive a certain number of tickets for each event, depending on the sponsorship level.  
Sponsors can choose the people they want to invite to each event, depending on the number of tickets they have for each event.  The next
step in this project is to write the data to a CSV file.
