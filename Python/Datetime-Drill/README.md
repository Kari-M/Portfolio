### Datetime Drill
***

This is a drill completed at The Tech Academy.  Students were asked to create a simple program with the following instructions:

Scenario: The company you work for just opened two new branches. One is in New York City,
the other in London. They need a very simple program to find out if the branches are open or
closed based on the current time of the Headquarters here in Portland. The hours of both
branches are 9:00AM - 9:00PM in their own time zone.

What is asked of you: 
Create code that will use the current time of the Portland HQ to find out the time in the NYC &
London branches, then compare that time with the branches hours to see if they are open or
closed.

Print out if each of the  two branches are open or closed.
