### Database & SQL Examples
***

SQL Library Drill

This is a database and SQL assignment that I completed at The Tech Academy.  The requirements were to build and populate the database, and to create SQL queries that will answer the following questions:

1. How many copies of the book titled The Lost Tribe are owned by the library branch whose name
is"Sharpstown"?

2. How many copies of the book titled The Lost Tribe are owned by each library branch?

3. Retrieve the names of all borrowers who do not have any books checked out.

4. For each book that is loaned out from the "Sharpstown" branch and whose DueDate is today,
retrieve the book title, the borrower's name, and the borrower's address.

5. For each library branch, retrieve the branch name and the total number of books loaned out from
that branch.

6. Retrieve the names, addresses, and number of books checked out for all borrowers who have more
than five books checked out.

7. For each book authored (or co-authored) by "Stephen King", retrieve the title and the number of
copies owned by the library branch whose name is "Central"
