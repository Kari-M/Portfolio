### File Transfer Drill
***

This is a Python drill completed at The Tech Academy.  Students were asked to create a simple program with the following instructions:

Scenario: Your company's users create or edit a collection of text files throughout the day. These text files represent data about customer 
orders.
Once per day, any files that are new, or that were edited within the previous 24 hours, must be sent to the home office. To facilitate this, 
these new or updated files need to be copied to a specific 'destination' folder on a computer, so that a special file transfer program can grab 
them and transfer them to the home office. The process of figuring out which files are new or recently edited, and copying them to the 'destination' 
folder, is currently being done manually. This is very expensive in terms of manpower.  
You have been asked to create a script that will automate this task, saving the company a lot of money over the long term. Users are also asking for a 
user interface to make using the script easier and more versatile. 

Desired features of the UI: 
1.) Allow the user to browse to and choose a specific folder that will 
contain the files to be checked daily. 
2.) Allow the user to browse to and choose a specific folder that will 
receive the copied files. 
3.) Allow the user to manually initiate the 'file check' process that 
is performed by the script.
4.) Include a database that records the date/time of the file check runs.
5.) Display the last 'file check date/time' on the UI
